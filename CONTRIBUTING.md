# Contributing to project ovh-ui-kit

This project accepts contributions. In order to contribute, you should
pay attention to a few things:

1. your code must follow the coding style rules
2. your code must be documented
3. your work must be signed (see below)
4. you may contribute through GitHub Pull Requests

All contributions are welcome. However, keeping in mind the primary goal
of this project, which is to provide a stylekit for the _OVH_ brand, we
**strongly recommend** that you submit a RFC pull request or reach out
to the [UX team on Gitter](https://gitter.im/ovh/ux) to discuss your
proposal first.

# Coding style rules

* Use the [BEM CSS selector naming convention](https://en.bem.info/methodology/naming-convention/).
* Lint your code with stylelint: `npm run lint`.
* Test your build: `npm run build`.

# Submitting Modifications

The contributions should be submitted through Github Pull Requests and
follow the DCO which is defined below.

# Licensing for new files

ovh-ui-kit is licensed under a modified BSD-3-Clause license. Anything
contributed to ovh-ui-kit must be released under this license.

When introducing a new file into the project, please make sure it has a
copyright header making clear under which license it's being released.

# Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

To improve tracking of contributions to this project we will use a
process modeled on the modified DCO 1.1 and use a "sign-off" procedure
on patches that are being emailed around or contributed in any other
way.

The sign-off is a simple line at the end of the explanation for the
patch, which certifies that you wrote it or otherwise have the right
to pass it on as an open-source patch.  The rules are pretty simple:
if you can certify the below:

```
By making a contribution to this project, I certify that:

 (a) The contribution was created in whole or in part by me and I have
 the right to submit it under the open source license indicated in
 the file; or

 (b) The contribution is based upon previous work that, to the best of
 my knowledge, is covered under an appropriate open source License
 and I have the right under that license to submit that work with
 modifications, whether created in whole or in part by me, under
 the same open source license (unless I am permitted to submit
 under a different license), as indicated in the file; or

 (c) The contribution was provided directly to me by some other person
 who certified (a), (b) or (c) and I have not modified it.

 (d) The contribution is made free of any other party's intellectual
 property claims or rights.

 (e) I understand and agree that this project and the contribution are
 public and that a record of the contribution (including all
 personal information I submit with it, including my sign-off) is
 maintained indefinitely and may be redistributed consistent with
 this project or the open source license(s) involved.
```

then you just add a line saying

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.org>
```

using your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions.)
