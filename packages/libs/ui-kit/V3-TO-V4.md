# Breaking Changes

With this major update, we apply the new guidelines from our [Design System](https://design.cxprojects.ovh/). The application of those guidelines will be done in multiple batch of changes. The v4.0.x consists of the first batch of changes.

The following batches will be released as minor versions and will not be breaking like this one.

## Stable changes

Moving from v3.x to v4.x should be easier than the previous major update.
But there are still notable changes, that we encourage to apply on your projects for easing the next updates.

We aim with this version to be as less breaking as possible with the functioning of the v3.x components.
